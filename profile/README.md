We are a community available for anyone to participate in, with the purpose of 
developing and encouraging the use of collaborative creative spaces
available under an [Approved License](https://the.quetzal.community/approved-licenses) 
where users can share their creations and retain free usage rights to their work.

We actively support and promote these projects and you can join us as a 
contributing member on Github by 
[starting a discussion](https://the.quetzal.community/.github/discussions)
and letting us know how you would like to contribute to our cause.

#### What is a Creative Space?
A creative space is generally a software application, webapp, or game where 
users can arrange primitive elements together to create new things.

If you are looking for creative spaces to explore, we maintain a list of
[Approved Spaces](https://the.quetzal.community/approved-spaces).

If you or your company wants to develop and maintain a profitable creative 
space, we maintain [The Quatzal Community Trademark Licenseâ„¢](https://the.quetzal.community/trademark-license) 
which may serve as a useful pathway for you to commercialise your creative spaces 
without restricting the creative freedom of your users. We will actively
support any products or services with substantial buildable source available 
under this license. 

Lastly, we maintain a [Wishlist](https://the.quetzal.community/wishlist) 
of proprietary creative spaces, or closed creative bubbles (that lack the ability to export),
that we hope to see either an alternative to, or a prompt release, under an 
approved Community License.
